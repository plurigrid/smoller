Shared Dependencies:

1. Python Packages: All files will share the Python packages "chyp", "hypergraphx", and "ypy". These packages will be used across multiple files for creating the hypergraph environment, generating diagrams, and managing the multiplayer system.

2. CRDT: The "crdt.py" file will define the CRDT (Conflict-free Replicated Data Type) operations and data structures. These will be used in "multiplayer_system.py" for managing the multiplayer system and in "main.py" for integrating all components.

3. Hypergraph Environment: The "hypergraph_environment.py" file will define the hypergraph environment. This will be used in "diagram_generator.py" for generating diagrams and in "main.py" for integrating all components.

4. Diagram Generator: The "diagram_generator.py" file will define the diagram generation functions. These will be used in "main.py" for integrating all components.

5. Multiplayer System: The "multiplayer_system.py" file will define the multiplayer system. This will be used in "main.py" for integrating all components.

6. Utility Functions: The "utils.py" file will define utility functions that can be used across all other files.

7. Requirements: The "requirements.txt" file will list all the Python packages needed for the project. This is shared across all files as it defines the necessary dependencies for the project.

Note: As this is a Python project, there are no DOM elements, message names, or JavaScript functions involved.
